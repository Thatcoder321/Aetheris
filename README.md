**Your Space. Your Web.**

## 🌌 What is Aetheris?

Let’s face it — the modern web is noisy. You’ve got a dozen tabs open, juggling a dozen different tools. It’s fragmented, distracting, and honestly... kind of exhausting.

**Aetheris is your personal command center — a desktop for the web, right in your browser.**

Built from the ground up with a “2.5D” visual style using CSS 3D transforms, widgets float in a parallax-responsive space that feels alive and reactive. You’re not just using a dashboard. You’re inhabiting one.

What started as a lighthearted project for Hack Club’s **Summer of Making** quickly spiraled into something deeper — a full creative and technical sprint driven by curiosity, caffeine, and the dream of a better digital workspace.

## 🧭 Philosophy

Aetheris is built on two simple beliefs:

### 1. **"It's your space. You should control it."**  
No more static dashboards or hardcoded layouts. With Aetheris, you can move, resize, customize, and even *redesign the entire thing* with natural language prompts like:



This is your space — and it should adapt to you, not the other way around.

### 2. **"Everything you need, in one place."**  
Aetheris is designed to eliminate tab overload by giving you everything you actually use — right in one unified environment. Stocks, weather, notes, timers, chats, widgets — all woven together in a cohesive, seamless UI.

## 🛠 The Journey

This wasn’t just a weekend hack. Aetheris took shape across **95+ commits**, **14 devlogs**, and one infamously stubborn bug known only as...

> **The Glass Pane.**  
> _The resize handles showed up... but you couldn’t click them. Not even a little._  

What followed was a war between 3D CSS, z-indexes, pointer-events, and Gridstack.js itself. It took days. It almost broke me. But it also marked a turning point — proof that even the weirdest bugs yield to enough patience and console logs.

Every widget you see, every animation, every pixel — it’s all part of that journey.

##  Tech Stack

Aetheris is fast, minimal, and framework-free. It’s built on **foundational tech** that respects performance and flexibility:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (ES6+). No React, Vue, or frameworks.
- **Layout Engine:** [Gridstack.js](https://gridstackjs.com/) for drag-and-drop awesomeness.
- **Backend:** Node.js Serverless Functions (API routes).
- **Auth:** GitHub OAuth2 for secure integration.
- **Hosting:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com) + CI/CD via GitHub.

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

Thanks for taking the time to check out Aetheris.

This started as a small experiment and grew into something I truly care about. I’ve tried to pour thoughtfulness, creativity, and love into every line of code — and I hope it makes your digital life feel a little more human.

Stay curious,
