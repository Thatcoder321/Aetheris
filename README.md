# ✨ Aetheris
**A new web**

## 🌌 What is this?
The web gets messy fast. Tabs everywhere. Tools scattered.

**Aetheris is a browser-based personal dashboard.**  
It feels like a desktop for the web: draggable widgets, subtle motion, layered 3D effects. All in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


---

## 🧠 Why build it?
Two simple reasons:

### 1) It should feel like your space  
Put things where you want. Resize them. Switch themes. Or just say:  
> “Make a productivity layout with weather and notes in the corner.”  
Done.

### 2) Everything you use, in one place  
No hopping between tabs to check the weather, jot a note, or run a timer. Open Aetheris and get to work.

## ⚡️ What it does
Comes with **16+ widgets**, all resizable and customizable:

-  **AI Chat** using GPT-4o mini
-  **Weather** with expandable detail
-  **Live Stocks** via Finnhub
-  **Productivity**: Pomodoro, to-do, notepad, countdowns
-  **Calculator** and **Unit Converter**
-  **Extras**: system stats, GitHub profile, quotes, news, quick links, more
