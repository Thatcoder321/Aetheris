# ✨ Aetheris  
**Your space. Your web.**

---

## 🌌 What is this?

The modern web is a mess — a dozen tabs, a dozen tools, all fighting for your attention.

**Aetheris is a browser-based personal dashboard.**  
Think of it like a desktop for the web: draggable widgets, parallax motion, 3D-style layout — all running on plain HTML/CSS/JS.

It started as a fun summer project, but turned into something bigger — a rethink of what a personal workspace could feel like.

---

## 🧠 Why?

Because I believe two things:

### 1. **It should feel like *your* space.**  
Move things around. Resize them. Change the theme. Or literally ask the AI:  
> “Hey, make it a productivity layout with weather + notes in the corner.”  
Boom — done.

### 2. **Everything you actually use, in one place.**  
No more jumping tabs to check the weather or jot a note. Just open Aetheris and it’s all there.

## ⚡️ What it does

Comes with **16+ widgets** out of the box — all resizable, customizable, and (we hope) useful:

- 💬 **AI Chat** – GPT-4o mini, built right in.
- 🌦 **Weather** – Smart layout that expands for more detail.
- 📈 **Live Stocks** – Real-time market data from Finnhub.
- ✅ **Productivity tools** – Pomodoro, to-do list, notepad, countdowns.
- 🔢 **Calculator + Unit Converter** – Clean and keyboard-friendly.
- 🖥 **Other widgets:** System stats, GitHub profile, quotes, news, quick links, and more.

### And the cool stuff:

- 🎯 **AI Layout Architect** – Rearrange everything with natural language.
- 🎛 **12-Column Grid System** – Drag and snap, precision-style.
- 🎨 **Themes** – One click to vibe-switch your whole dashboard.
- ☁️ **Cloud Sync** – All your layouts saved, cross-device.

## 🛠 Built with

Aetheris doesn’t rely on big frameworks. Just the essentials:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (with CSS 3D), and Vanilla JS
- **Layout Engine:** [Gridstack.js](https://gridstackjs.com/)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Serverless API routes)
- **Auth:** GitHub OAuth2
- **Hosting:** Vercel + GitHub CI

## 🧪 The Build Journey

This wasn’t just a weekend sprint. Over **95 commits**, **14 devlogs**, and one ridiculously stubborn bug (shoutout to *The Glass Pane™*)...

> “The handles were there. But they wouldn’t click. At all. For days.”  

Turns out 3D transforms + z-index + Gridstack = chaos.  
But hey, it made everything smoother in the end.

## 📍 Coming Soon (v1.2)

- 🔌 **Widget-to-Widget API** – Let tools talk to each other (e.g., Pomodoro ↔ Notes)
